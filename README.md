## Hi there, I'm Serena!!
I am a Master's student at Ca' Foscari University and I am attending the 'Computer Science and Information Technology' course with specialization in 'Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering'. 

In my bachelor degree at Ca' Foscari University I became acquainted with data analysis and data science and was hooked from the very first moment! I was immediately fascinated by the fact that there is a whole world behind a single piece of data if you have the right insight! 

I really love english (B2/C1) and I know even a bit of french (A1) and german (A1)! Plus, a good resolution of mine this year was to start studying Spanish (A2) on my own and I find it really funny! 

Anyway, I'm a very active and busy person! Indeed, in my spare time I am a scout, a dancer and a speaker on a local podcast!
